Run, mom! The tree is falling! "A film by Ly Hai" "Face Off: The Walking Guest" This is the hot spot. We have to approach our target by all means safely and in time. We have only a few minutes. If we can't make it our plan will fail. Therefore, every action must follow my order. Distance is 200 meters from here. Our average speed is 50 km/h. So it will take us about 2 minutes. There will be many unexpected obstacles on the way. I strongly recommend everyone to concentrate and stay focused. Keep our formation and be ready to support each other. I will go first. Binh holds the left side. Thong holds the right side. Vy and Phuong will cover the back. We have to protect our target against everything. -Is everyone clear? -Yes! 10 seconds. 4 3 2 1 and let's start. What is this? I mean... seriously? If I knew about this, there is no way we would have chosen you. I'm sorry. We have tried our best. But you guys wanted to have your photos... taken during the most crowded time. This might be the first time for you guys But we have seen it a zillion time. Could we go a bit earlier tomorrow? You mean 3 a.m.? No way! Take it easy. If you agree to have the background changed we will find you a new one to compensate. Hope you can understand. Alright. We just need it to be beautiful and romantic. Please don't give me such horrible place like today. It's like going to a war. Wow, so pretty! We should've come earlier. You never tell us that your hometown is such a beautiful place. I would've even suggested to the customer... to come here for their photographs. It's quite peaceful here. Don't disturb everything. Why haven't you gone back home for a while? Well I planned to go several times but then I was too busy with work. Luckily, my brother is still at home taking care of my mom. Huan is so thoughtful giving a chance for his girlfriend to come home. He also prepares some gifts. -That's neat. -He's invested a lot in this. He will meet his mother-in-law for the first time. Has to do it. Mother-in-law? Where is she? Almost. He never has any gift for us. Be his girlfriend and he will. That's nuts! If I were a girl, I would steal Huan from Vy. He's such a thoughtful guy. What about me? Don't you have any mirror at home? A crocodile! -Crazy! -What? -What is it? -A fish! How much is the chicken? So cute. Hey, there's a dog. -Hey. -I love it! -And pig! -Gosh, I love it. And cow! Let's go, we're late! Go ahead and buy it. -300. -Is it still alive? Any discount? Fine, 250. -What's that? -A snake. It's so cool. Yeah! Hurry up! Hurry up, guys! It's so beautiful up here. It's so sunny. It's beautiful but I'm so tired -It's your fault anyway. -Why me? Why did you bring a lot of stuff? I'm a professional trekker. You're no better than him. We go to the mountain yet you bring a swimsuit. You two are such weirdos. Mr. Ba, how are you? Oh, hey. Auntie Lan, how are you doing? It's me, Vy. Why didn't you go home earlier? What does he mean? Just go. Such a pretty landscape here. -Hey. -What? -Maybe I will move here. -Yes. Gosh. What? I will buy you a spot here. Are you crazy? Buy for Binh. I don't need it. Don't make fun of this! -Vy. -What? -Is your house here? -We just pass by. There used to be a shortcut here, we'd only need to cross the bridge. However, it has collapsed. There aren't many people here and nobody bothered to rebuild it. Hi. Why are they so cold here? This is a sad city. We've arrived. It's kind of eerie. It's kind of spooky. I think it's kind of lonesome. Well, I think you all should go back to sleep at the cemetery. No kidding. You talk too much, let's go! This house belongs to a friend of my father. He has lived abroad for a long time. My parents went bankrupt so we had to sell our old house. He told us to move in here also to take care of his house. Mom, I'm home. Hoang, I'm home. Guys, come on in. Mom, I'm home. Mom! Mom! Hoang, it's me! I think we haven't paid the electric bill. We won't have Wi-Fi for sure. It's starting to look like in the movies. That's my father. I drew that picture. The eyes don't look much friendly. I can't look at his eyes. The eyes... Vy doesn't look like her father. Must be like her mother. Mom, I'm home. This house must have automatic doors. But there is no electricity. Please no more automatic door. Mom, I'm home. Oh my God! What's that? It's just a shirt but it scared the hell of me. Come in, everyone. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! Hey Vy, have you just got home? Yes, mom. What happened to Hoang? Last month, after coming home from school your brother said he had a headache, then he freaked out and acted like a lost soul since. I have given him many medicines but none works. I even hired some priests to perform... the exorcism but it didn't help either. I don't know whether he's been possessed by anyone. Hoang, come up here. It's too dangerous to swim there. You're such a pansy. They're seized because they don't know how to swim. That's not an excuse! Hoang! Hoang! He's scared of everything now, especially the light and the noise. So he stays in his room most of the time. He only goes out at night, when it's all quiet. I will go up to see him. Maybe later, he's not stable yet. I'm afraid he will get worse. I will let you guys see him later. Just don't go into his room yourselves. Yes, ma'am. I forgot to introduce to you. They are my colleagues. -Huan, my boyfriend. -Hi. Phuong, Thong, Binh, -we're on the same team. -Hi. Hi. Hi, I've noticed this. Vy doesn't look like her father nor you. Vy has told me a lot about you guys. Are you tired? -No, ma'am. -No, ma'am. Can we leave the doors open down here? Of course. Make yourselves at home. I will go prepare something for dinner. Yes, ma'am. 2 3... 1 2 3 Yeah. Dinner is ready. Let me help you. Come here. Since Hoang was sick, I've never had time to clean up. The storm has caused the trees to fall over breaking all the power cables. No one came to repair yet. If you don't mind you're welcome to stay here. Don't worry, we can sleep anywhere. Well we have nothing to complain except that without the electricity, how can we charge the batteries? Use the power bank then. Put your camera away. There is a small room next to this one. You guys can split for more space. It's okay, it's more fun sleeping together. We get used to sleep at the company though. Alright, it's up to you. Just remember not to make so much noise at night. Sure, don't worry. -Let's eat while they're still hot. -Enjoy your meal. I'm sorry I haven't come home for a while. I understand. You're so busy. But what happened to your phone? I've tried to call you for months. I was so worried. Since your brother was sick, I forgot where I put it. Besides, no one calls me that often. Mom, you can be proud of your daughter. I have managed to buy an apartment. I want you and Hoang to move in with me. I don't want to go. I don't know what I will do there. Wait until your brother is not sick anymore, take him to live with you. But you will be here all alone. Don't worry about me. Whatever you do, take good care of yourself. Without health, money means nothing. Go away. Hey... hey guys. Wake up! Wake up! -What's up? -Something happened. -What? -Come here, quickly. What? I'm still sleeping. What? See! There's nothing. Nonsense. You... Aren't you sleeping? Strange place, and also I heard some noises. Well... I just gave Hoang some medicine. -Yes. -Go back to sleep. Yes. Flour should be grinded down to fine particles to avoid curdling while adding water. When rolling the pin, coat it with some flour to prevent it from sticking. Keep your hands steady. Wake up and let's go find some backgrounds. You sleep all the time. You kept insisting on carrying a heavy backpack and now sleep like a pig. Hurry up! We're waiting downstairs. Hey. Why do you suddenly seem interested? Want to become her son-in-law? -Dude! -Oops! What are you making? Fried fish cake noodle soup. This is Vy's most favourite dish. Lucky you! Where are you going? How about breakfast? It's okay. We have to go look for the backgrounds. Right. Don't worry. They have packed a lot of food. Are you guys leaving me? Gosh. Does your face look really dark or is it because I'm wearing shades? Gosh. Why is your face is so dark? I couldn't sleep last night. How did you guys sleep so soundly? Drop it! It's just a strange place. Let's go! Ma'am. We should get going now. -Alright, have fun. -Thanks. Hey, there is a beautiful waterfall over there. Okay, thank you. How did I do? The fish must be grinded so the texture will be springy when cooked. Okay! Mom, you can cook it, why would you still want us to learn? Huan loves cooking. Maybe you can teach him. And spare me from this. I won't live with you forever. And for Huan, among hundreds of restaurant dishes, none can compare to one home cooked meal from you. Guess what. No matter how busy your father was, he always come home and we would have the meals together. Mom, don't think too much. This waterfall is so beautiful. If we take this angle, our customers will surely request for this trip. It's even more beautiful over there. Thong! The cool place over there. Yeah. The cliff! Those rocks are beautiful! So pretty. Let's take a selfie together. -Right, let's do it. -Right. 1 2 3 Yeah! Let's take individual pictures. -Individual? -What? -Make sure the waterfall is behind me. -Okay. Okay, raise your hand. Raise your hand. You guys should go somewhere else. It's dangerous here. Didn't you see that warning sign? There's a group that came here to take pictures. One guy slipped and fell. The whole group jumped off to save him. All of them died. Really? They even built a shrine here. It's sacred. If you guys still stand there, they might come after you. Mister, there must be many ghosts around, right? We'd avoid that word here. Respect them or they will follow you. What should we say then? We call them "guests". I got it! Hoang must've been followed by some... ghosts because he kept saying that word. He just said not to use the word "ghost"... -No "ghost." -Right. Where are you staying? We stay in that house over there. Mister! -Mister! -Mister! -Mister! -Mister! My dad passed away. He committed suicide... due to pressure from his creditors. But that was a long time ago. He's a nice guy and never haunts people. That's my mom's room. And this is my dad's. My dad used to sit in this room and draw paintings for extra cash. Digital photos weren't that popular, so he mostly painted portraits of the deceased. It's also why mom wouldn't want me to take Art major. Who turns on the music at such right moment? Maybe there is a funeral going on. What happened to your hand? I got red paint all over them. -Vy? -Yeah? Have you ever seen any ghost? -Gosh! -What? How dare you say that word? You might be followed. Don't you remember? Out there? It's hard to answer your question. If we think there is no ghost, there is no ghost. Otherwise they would exist. We'd better not think about it. -No ghost! -No ghost! No ghost! No ghost! No ghost! What? Who just thought of it? I didn't mean to. Why is everyone so tense? It must be Hoang, my brother. Why is everything on automatic? Going to shower, Phuong? Yes. You two were so fast! How come you didn't wait for me? Binh hasn't showered yet. Ask him then. It's too cold, I will skip today. If you don't want to shower, at least be my guard. If I'm going, I'd rather take a shower already. I'm so sleepy. Good night, guys. Don't tell me that you want me to guard for you. That's right. Please treat me well. I always treat you well. You're like my son. Let's go. Son, I will guard outside. Let's go, son. Binh! -What? -Why didn't you shower? We've been out all day. I've changed into clean clothes. You stink! Heavens, it's so cold! Hurry up, it's cold out here too. Oh my God! Why didn't you lock the door? And why aren't you taking off your shorts? In case I have to run. Think about it. If something happens, do I have time to put on my pants? Gosh, you're so sexy! I will close the door now. It's unpleasant when some guy is peeping in. Hey! Give me a shout if there's something out there. Sure, be quick. I will guard the door. Hurry up. -Thong! -What? Say something. What should I say? Say something so I know you're still there. Thong. Sing a song. -What? -Hurry up! If you stop talking, you'd be finished by now. It's cold and you talk too much. I'm so cold, sis. I'm so cold. I'm colder than you. Sister, I'm so cold. I said I'm colder. I'm so cold... -I'm so cold, sis. -Enough, Thong! I... I... Thong? -Sister, I'm so cold. -No kidding here. Sister. Darn you, you ran away without telling me. I'm sorry. I saw a "guest." "Guest?" Where? The swing. Hey... Stop it. Don't talk nonsense about their house. You still have your big mouth now. I dare you to go close the windows. Go! How about leaving them open for some breeze? Why do I have to sleep on the far side? Just sleep! My goodness. Are you going to sleep with your wet shorts full of soap? Disgusting! Perhaps you can go and... Gosh! -Gosh! -Wow, is that even possible? It's dry now. Go to sleep. You guys are so noisy. Sleep! What now? Are you possessed? I'm shy! Feeling another man's skin for the first time. Interesting. Give me some blanket. You guys are stealing all of it. Ouch! What's wrong? Why aren't you sleeping? Stop poking my back with your finger. My hands are here. Just ignore it. You guys are so annoying. Sleep! Urgh! I can't sleep with you guys! Hey guys! I'm sleeping on the far side but you're stealing all the blanket. Alright. Let's tell stories about "guests." Whoever's afraid can sleep on the outermost. Are you crazy? Putting scared people on the outermost side of the bed? Fine, stay where you are then. Okay, I'll go first. You are so bossy. You're lying next to the wall but still want to go first. Yeah. This is a real story Vy told me last week. One late night, when Vy got home from work. Everyone from her building was sleeping. There was no one in the basement. She was afraid, so she tried to walk fast. Suddenly, she heard some footsteps behind. What's that? I just made some sound effect. She turned around but saw no one. She hastened to the elevator... and kept pressing the button. The footsteps were approaching. Once the door opened, she rushed inside. She pressed the 15th floor button. The door was closing while the steps got much closer. She pressed again and again... Did she make it? -Yes. -Yeah? She heaved a sigh of relief. The elevator slowly went up... but suddenly stopped at 3rd floor. The door started opening. Someone was coming in, right? The hallway was clear. But there's no one. The light was flickering. Then, the door closed again. And the electricity went off. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Did Vy panic? Exactly! While she's panicking, the power came back on and someone appeared from nowhere. Vy was sweating. She didn't know if he was a bad guy or a "guest." The elevator started moving again. -Which floor was he heading to? -Right! Where is he going? -I will go and ask the guy. -Stop interrupting his story. Just continue. He didn't press any button or moved an inch. The elevator continued going up. Vy's heart was racing like crazy. The elevator continued going up, but it didn't stop at 15th floor. It stopped at 17th floor. She was so afraid, so she exited the elevator... and used the staircase to get to her floor. While running, she kept looking back to see if he was following. Stop! I give up! We're lucky he's given up! I was about to give up as well. Let's sleep. Huan! Yes? What happened next? Still haven't slept? Go to sleep! But I'm too curious I can't sleep. Aren't you afraid? We still have to know the ending. Vy headed to her apartment. Meanwhile, she turned around. Did the guy disappear? You too? Not able to sleep. No! The guy was still there. Vy was scared, so she darted to the end of the hall. Standing in front of her neighbour's apartment, she pretended to grab for the keys and checked if the guy would leave. But he didn't. Vy was terrified and started knocking on the doors asking for help. Someone saved her? No one opened the door. She decided to go to her apartment. She went for the keys. She couldn't find them. Vy turned around. The guy was coming closer. She tried to look for the keys. They were nowhere to be found. She emptied her purse in hope of finding her keys. She found one, and tried to insert it. It didn't fit. Another key, still didn't fit. She kept trying. The guy was getting closer and closer. She was terrified and suddenly, he grabbed her arm. Enough, I can tell how his face was. Keep quiet, let him finish. We won't be able to sleep without knowing how it ended. And you too? Your story is getting very interesting. I've been trying to listen. Why are you so scared of me? You dropped your phone. It's so tired catching up with you. What a nice security guy! If it was me, I would've beaten him to death. I have to sleep on the far side because of him. This plant, right? Good job, I showed you only once and you were able to find the correct plant. -Leave it to me. -Here. -Honey! -Yes? This medicine will have good effect on you. Oops, I forgot. There is still one missing medicine for Hoang. Well... The plant is over there. -Be careful, mom! -Those plants always... grow among the grasses. If you don't look carefully, you won't recognize them. Okay. Be careful. Told you there isn't anything on that side. Stop complaining. Dealing with art takes time. How do we know there's nothing if we didn't go? The landscape is uglier than me. You're right. What are you doing, Binh? -"Guests." -What? We have "guests." What "guests"? It's daytime. There can't be any "guest." You know nothing. While I was sleeping, Hoang came and strangled me. He even pinned me down. Are you out of your mind? Nonsense, you're just experiencing sleep paralysis. Vy's brother is sick, he doesn't have much strength. You know nothing. I'm leaving. For real? Did you tell Vy about it? -No. -OK. Bye bye my friend. Hey. Just ignore him and take more pictures over there. You're so heartless. I'm sure he'll be back in 30 seconds. This is yours, this is mine. The air is so fresh here. My dad often took me here to pick the flowers. What do you think of this place? It's nice. -Vy. -What? This angle is perfect. Stand there so I can take some sample pictures. Good idea. Mom, let's take a picture together. Nah, it's okay. Let me take a picture of you two. Huan, go over there. Hold on, what should I do? Just press here, that's all. -Alright, stay closer. -Yes. Smile. Cheer! 1 2 3. -Okay, check it out. -Yes. -How is it? -Perfect! It's perfect! Let's go home. Let's go. See, this is what we call beauty. Stand there, I will take a legendary photo of yourself. Sure... You're a model. Don't you know how to pose? What model? I'm a lighting technician. I'm not a model. "Le Thi La" "20.12.1958" So? Why are you speechless? Am I too beautiful? Do you have my legendary photo? Looks more like a portrait for the deceased. Let's go elsewhere. But you just said this is the most beautiful spot? There are better places. See? I was right. He came back within 30 seconds. What happened? Why did you come back? You didn't dare to cross the cemetery, did you? There were many of them here. There's one over there. We should go back now. -Come with me. -No. -Why? -We haven't found any... background for our guests. Which "guests"? Our customers. But we can't stay here, not with Hoang's presence. Then, stop thinking about him. Are you crazy? He is right there in the opposite room. How about, we go straight into his room and check on him? All 3 of us. Ouch... Hey! Ouch... "Guests" will most likely come out of these holes. Do you want to lead? You are the toughest, you should go first. Hey! In the movies, the "guests" usually appear from behind. You mean behind me? So, do you want to go in front? Nah. Let's turn our backs against the wall and let's go. It's the automatic door again. I don't like it. -Thong. -What? Check if anyone is in there. I don't dare to look. Just close your eyes and go. I'm having chills all of a sudden. My mom said chills means there is a "guest." What? The "guest" allows us to pass. Let's go! Why stop here? I'm in the danger zone. I'm trapped. Faster. Gosh, you guys really go in there? Unlimited human potential! Let's go. Hoang, we've come to visit you. Hoang! Hoang! Are you trying to make it more dramatic? Please, stop talking like a "guest." Just talk normally. Maybe a bit louder. You told me to keep my voice down. Well but not that low. Speak up! Hoang. May I come in? Watch out! Hoang! I'm so sorry. Hoang! I'm sorry for the noise... Just shut your mouth and go in. Hey. Why are you frozen? What is it? Hey... What? Oh my God! Hurry up! Hurry up! Wait for me! Wait for me! What's wrong? -Nothing. -Nothing. We're going inside then. Hey. Come here. What? There is a "guest" in Vy's house. What do you mean? "Guest" is someone who passed away. You mean ghost? Don't say that word. It's a forbidden word here. If the "guests" hear it, they will follow you. Anyway, who's the "guest"? Hoang, Vy's brother. -Hoang? -Yeah. -Liar. -Gosh. You always talk nonsense. I'm serious. Thong and I saw it, too. I swear. If you don't believe me, go to Hoang's room. It's scary. Go on. Go! -No way. -What? Find some time to talk to Vy. Vy, are you hanging clothes? Let me help you. -Vy. -Yeah? There is a "guest" in your house. Of course, you're my guests. No. No that. You mean I'm the guest here? Not you either. It's Hoang, your brother. Why do you all call my brother a guest? To make it simple. Your brother is a G. H. O. S. T. What is G. H. O. S. T.? They are letters. Put them together. Goths? Nope. Try again. G. H. O. S. T.? Please allow me to say it once, just once. Vy, G. H. O. S. T. means... Luckily, I haven't said it. Interesting. Every time I'm about to say it, something's holding me back. Whatever it is then. So were you able to find any good place? Can I see? Isn't it beautiful? The place Huan and I went was nice. Just say it. -Say it. -Say it. No, you say it. Say! Well... Vy, it's about to rain, come inside. Don't get wet in the rain. Yes, mom. Let's go inside. I just bought these shoes for Hoang last month. Who put them here? It's alright. You might be uncomfortable the first few times. The pain will soon be gone. It's good medicine. It's about to rain. Get inside the house. I will grab the clothes. Guys, go upstairs and close the windows... to prevent water from getting into the house. Yeah. Mom! Quickly go inside! Mom. I've told you many times. Don't go outside while it's raining. It's dangerous. It's nothing. I do it all the time. You are making me worried. Has anyone closed the windows? We already have. It's the middle of the day but we have to use a lamp. I mean the windows upstairs. Not yet. Why? Can't you do one simple thing? It's scary up there. We won't go up anymore. What do you mean? Vy, Hoang has passed away. Gosh, he's dead. What are you talking about? Vy! -Vy! -Vy! -Vy! -Vy! Ma'am, are you alright? Vy, wait for me! Vy! Where is Hoang? Gosh. I told you that Hoang was sick. He's afraid of noises. But you guys didn't listen. Hoang! Mom! Hoang! Hoang! My goodness! Hoang! Mom! Don't just stand there! Help my mom find Hoang! Mom! Come here! Hoang! Mom! Mom! Hey, don't we have anywhere else to search? My mom said this place belongs to the living during daytime, and the dead when night falls. This place is overwhelmed with the dead. Binh is right. We've just heard the music yesterday. There is a fresh one here. Stop talking rubbish. Sure, I just want to go home. -No! -Let's go home. We won't return without Hoang! Hoang! Don't leave me! Mom! There's someone over there! -Really? -Yeah. Hoang? Where is he? Over there. Hoang! Shh. He's afraid of noises. Now you can use your previous "tone." Hoang! Hoang! -Hoang, where are you? -He was right here. Why is he sitting over there? "Guests" will often invite... mentally unstable people to stay with them. Hoang, we're coming to you. Hoang, what's that? Where are you going this late at night? We have some business. It's not like we want to be here. We're looking for our brother. Have you seen anyone? No, I see no one. How come you keep disappearing? I'm trying to follow the snake. And... this flashlight. It's turning on and off. Darn it! Please go home. -Yeah. -Let's go home! My gosh, what now? Why do you keep calling me under the storm? I might get struck by lightning. Okay, got it. What a matching ringtone you have there! Jeez, just go! Guys, Hoang is back! Hoang is back! Is he? Mr. Bay Chon, what are you doing here? Ask these dummies. -Please tell them to go home. -You know each other? Go, go! It's strange. His name is Bay Chon but he's catching snakes. Dude. Leave my name alone! Don't be so nosy! Stop asking or he will catch you! Is Hoang okay? Mom said he got home and went straight into his room. It could be that we're causing many trouble here so Hoang was afraid and went back to the house. Sister, I'm cold. I'm so cold. We're glad that Hoang is back. Otherwise we will feel very bad. It's just misunderstanding. You must be puzzled about the incense bowl. I made it myself and put it in his room so he can sleep well. I think Hoang doesn't exist! You mean he is dead? I think he died in his room. It's not necessary to put the incense bowl exactly where someone dies. He could've died right here. What are you doing? I think he died where you're laying now. Could it be that Hoang is dead but Vy's mom can't accept the fact? Something is wrong with her mind. I know you're worried about your brother. But it's not a good time yet. I will tell you when your brother recovers. What should we do now? Thong, Phuong, go downstairs and watch Vy's mom. You and I will go over to Hoang's room. Keep quiet. Shh. Gosh! Just go! Gosh. Shh. Quiet! -Gosh. -Come back here! Slowly. Heavens. Take off your shoes! I thought we all stay. -Ouch. -Let me. It's already late, you guys should sleep. Don't cause too much noise. It might scare Hoang. Yes. Besides, I can't sleep due to those noise either. Yes. Mom! Where did you find it? I've been searching everywhere. You're so careless. How can you call me without your phone? You can use my phone for now. Yours is broken. I will fix it. I can buy another phone when I go back to Saigon. You might be uncomfortable the first few times. The pain will soon be gone. It's good medicine. I used to treat your dad's sinusitis with this. -Give it to me. -You tell her. Hi. Hi. Do you guys plan to go somewhere today? Well... ma'am... -What? -We're free today. -Can we take Hoang to the hospital? -Yes. It's okay. He is sick and shouldn't go outside. Moreover, I don't think it's good to combine many different medicines. The one he was taking is showing some positive effect. Ma'am! Yes? Patients are often taken out to hospital gardens... for some sunlight and fresh air in the morning. Can we take Hoang out? No way, he's afraid of the light. Alright, stay home or go out, do whatever you like. I have to go collect the herb. -Yes. -Yes. See you. Goodbye. Take care. Okay. I want to go buy something for my mom's birthday. Make her surprised. Want to go with me? Thank God. I thought we'd be stuck here. There are many beautiful places here! Indeed. Want to buy some flipflop? -What? -Want to buy some flipflop? Are you crazy? What for? How about flowers? We already have flowers at home. It's nice. Go. Hello. Banana! Buy some... and make banana cake for your mom! So many flower lanterns! Sis! -Hey Vy! You just came back? -Yes. You must be so busy. We know him! Mr. Bay Chon! So you're selling stuff here? You were catching snakes last night. How come you're selling rats now? I wonder what you'll be selling tomorrow. Probably lizards or geckos. You guys are so annoying. I was fortunate to find some rats. How can you sell rats from the cemetery? They've been feeding on human flesh! Just go away! -Please let us stay here. -Go, go, go! No! Let's go! They're so weird. After what happened to her family, she doesn't show any emotions at all. She even hangs out with her friends here like some kind of celebration. Mom, slowly. 1, 2, 1, 2, ... On your right. Wow. Happy birthday to you Blow the candle. Thank you. I'm so happy. It's the first time to have so many people at my birthday. It's a pity... It's a pity that Hoang can't join us. Mom, you're supposed to be happy today. Cheer up! Tonight, it's go hard or go home! Wrong, we're already at home. Well then, go hard or go away. Cheers! I have this game to lighten up the mood. It's really fun. Would you join us? The game is called: Quick question, True answer! Within 5 seconds, whoever doesn't answer or answer it wrongly, will take a punishment specified in one of these cards. Is it fun? It is! -Who goes first? -Me! Okay, go ahead. What is Huan most afraid of? 5 4 3 2 1 Rat! Wrong, it's ghost! Hey! "Guest". Alright, read it out loud. Act like a larva. She's like a larva now. More like a worm. I have a question for Binh. What's the first thing you do after pissing? Gosh! -Pull up my zipper, it's easy! -Too easy! Wrong! -Wrong? -You shiver. Gosh. Okay, you win. Laugh in 5 different ways. Ouch! You sound like crying. We'll let it slip this time. -Yeah, pass. -Right. Huan, a question for you. What's Vy's mother's name? 5...4...3...2...1 Time's up. You don't even know the name of your girlfriend's mother? That's horrible. You have to cosplay as a... broken doll. Hey, turn around. My name is Le Thi La. -Yes. -Today is my 60th birthday. Do you remember? Don't you forget! I paid for my mistake already. "20-12-1958" Please spare me. No, I don't forget easily. "Le Thi La" "20-12-1958" What? "Le Thi La" "20.12.1958" Never mind. On three, 1 2 3. What are you two doing? Hey? Where are you going? I still have one question. Correct! Phuong, what is Thong thinking? 5...4...3...2 I give up. How can I know what is in his mind? Take a card. -Take one. Hurry up. -Take one card. And read it. -Read it! -Read it! -Give it to me. -Read it! I don't know how to read. -Rubbish. -Kiss the previous winner. Kiss... kiss... -Hurry up! -Do it with me. Nah, enjoy it yourself. Kiss... kiss... It's just like kissing your mom. Come here. Don't make me wait. Hurry up. Come... here... Come... here... Hurry up. Kiss... kiss... Let's continue. I'm so tired. Thong can take my turn. Thong, what's your question? He's tired, I'll take him upstairs. -What... -Hey... Just ignore him. -Cheers. -It's fun here. 1 2 3 Cheers! Man, so there are 2 "guests" here instead of 1. I'm so drunk but still can't sleep. I'm drunk but I can't sleep either. Every time when I close my eyes, it brings back the memory of that kiss. I will keep my eyes open the whole night. Or maybe we can go home. No! Stay here for now. We will decide after we tell Vy. Don't ever think of going back now. So you tell her then. She will not trust any of us. He's right. Hurry up and tell her. Dude! -Hurry up! -Vy. -Yeah? -You... Are you knitting a scarf? Yeah, we all can see that. We are not blind. Obviously, she's not sewing a blanket. The scarf is for your mom, isn't it? Of course. Who else, her father? Can you ask a question that makes sense? I promised to do this for my mom a long time ago. I haven't been able to finish it. Your mom... What about her? Your mom is here. Aren't you going anywhere today? Come here and have some chicken. Eat while it's still hot. -I will be upset if you don't eat some. -Come and eat. See... What? Isn't it familiar? -Put it there. -Yes. How can you eat sitting like that? Yes. Why are you so afraid of me? You're acting like I'm a ghost. Sit here. Okay. Scoot over. Please sit down. Let me do it. Here, for you. Binh. You were praising the chicken. Take a bite or she will get mad. Ma'am, why is there incense smell all over it? Because it was put on the altar. Try it. -Here -Try it. Don't make her upset. Phuong, have some bite. I can only eat duck meat. Are you up to some new game? No, the game yesterday was enough. Why don't you stay inside here? Why bother moving out? Well... We want to explore the nature. It'd be a waste if the gears we brought aren't used. Vy, have some extra. I've had too much. "Vy's mom is "GUEST"." You... Who is texting me? You... Here is your phone. Thanks. Why don't you just talk to me directly? Why bother texting? You're wasting credit! Before I forget, there's a flower lantern festival tonight. Come with me! I used to attend every year when I was here. It'll be fun. I feel a bit tired. You're afraid of crossing the cemetery, aren't you? Mom will come with us, too. You know that Binh is a coward. So I will stay home with him. Me too. Fine. So, will you come with me? -Okay. -What? -Vy. -Yes? Huan... He is having a bad stomachache. Go and check on him. I'm coming. Quick. -It's okay now. -Lie down. Come here. What are you doing? You will see. This is what people often do in the movies. Keep groaning. Are you okay? Poor him. He's all sweaty. My stomach hurts so bad. It's probably the chicken. I thought so, too. -Vy! -What? I have something to tell you. Sounds like you're saying your last words. Tell me. Where is he? Not me. Drink this glass of wine, you'll feel better. Here. Go back to your room. You shouldn't be lying on the ground like this. -Do you understand? -Yes. Here, drink this. -Drink! -I feel much better now. Vy, I know you'll find it hard to accept. But try to hear me out. Your mom is dead! What are you talking about? I don't know how to explain. We aren't making it up. Shut up, everyone. You've got to accept it. Both your mom and your brother are dead. Are you out of your minds? We are not. Then, who just brought you the drink? She's a ghost. Oh my God! You're too much! Vy, listen to me. If you don't believe, come with me. "Le Thi Lan" "20.12.1958" Do you have anything else to say? My mom is not Le Thi Lan. You don't even have any proof for Hoang. Huan, you're not a kid anymore. I can't imagine you'd act like an idiot! And you guys, I let it go when you tried to mess with my brother. But you wouldn't leave my mom out of this! What have they done wrong to you? Let me warn you one last time. Leave my family alone. I'm sorry, Vy. I don't need your apology. Get the hell out of here. I'm afraid when I turn around, I'd lose the world... my world... is you... I'm afraid my love isn't big enough so I can hold you tight, I can forgive... One time is all it takes... to lose your trust and to break your heart Sitting here waiting for a miracle We can go back to the first day we met You said you would never want to see me My heart still blames me for walking out I was wrong for the things I couldn't do for you I can endure a long night but how can I endure my life without you Someone's here. Hey, mister. Can you tell us if we can catch a ride here? Not at this hour. You should come earlier. Try the next intersect. You might have a chance. Is it far away? Maybe an hour on foot. Mister. Did you see anyone by the stream? So... you didn't go home until now... after you've seen it? Seen what? The "guest." I didn't dare to say it the other day, because we're too close to the house. I often see her wandering around. There are so many "guests" there. Not just one. There are two! Hurry up. Or you won't get there before morning. She changed the name on the tombstone. She also dripped something into Vy's nose. It looked painful. I'm sure she's up to something. Vy must be in danger. I will... -Hey! -Huan. Think carefully. Let me go. Don't go back there, Huan. -I have to save her. -It's dangerous! Isn't it pretty? Let's go there. Hurry up! What's up? Who is that? -It's Mr. Bay Chon. -Who? Who? Gosh, Mr. Bay Chon. Hey, it's you again! Please stop interfering with my business. I'm sorry. We need to go in there. For what? How brave you are! Tell you what. It's ten times spookier in there. In this area, only I dare to be around here at night. Wow. You're so bold! Bold? You must be well prepared. See this charm? And this? See? There are more. Garlic. I have all the tools. You're the brave ones. -Let's go. -Hold on. Don't you see he's well prepared? So what? Tell him to come with us. -Why aren't you leaving? -What? -Mr. Bay. -What? How many snakes can you catch at night? 1 or 2 if I'm lucky. I can sell for a few hundred. Okay. But if it's like tonight... You know what I will be selling tomorrow, right? Rats! Don't worry. Just help us with something... and we'll pay you 10 times the price for snakes. And what is this? You don't have to do anything, just follow us. -Do nothing? -Yes. -Then I will get paid? -Yes. Mom, I have seen a lot of people praying. Will every wish come true? Sure, if you believe in what you are doing. Okay. Time flies. I remember when you carried me on your back to school. Are you saying I'm old now? I'm still pretty strong. Were you tired back then? Yes, but it was fun. Perhaps I can try to carry you on my back. -I want to know how it feels. -Never mind. I can walk. Get on my back. Mom. Are you strong enough? Yes, I still can walk. Are you tired? No. Let's go! Who are you looking for? Shh... I'll never participate in robbery. Hey, mister. Rest assured, we're not doing anything illegal. -For real? -For real! In fact, we're helping people. I beg you. It's 10 snakes. What's that? Mister. When everyone is out, we have to prove that Vy's mother is a "guest." If there's internet connection, we would've known... -how to perform an exorcism. -Right! You have it right here. Mister Google is standing next to you. Really? I'm not joking. Everyone has his own method of exorcism. Somebody uses salt or rice, some uses the mirror... Drop it. This is not a normal "guest." -This "guest" is a VIP. -Yes. Well.. It's not just a mere shadow walking back and forth. It can present right next to you, just like me. Pretending to be your wife or your kid. That's insulting! It's just an example. So, do you have any other way? That was too hard. It's still too diluted. Our faces are turning pale, and you're saying it's diluted? Well, help us then. Well... I'm asking you to give some of your own blood. Look at how skinny I am! Mister, is your knife clean? I don't know. I use it to cut the snakes every day. Oh my God! This should be enough. Here is the plan. Two of us will take this bucket upstairs. And the other two will stay here. I'll wait at the door. When she shows up, I will give you a signal. Then, you two come over and start taking pictures. She won't be able to see anything with all the flash. That's the signal to dump the blood bucket on her. And she will disappear. We can only do it once. There is no room for failure. Test the flash. Do it again! We ran out of blood. Is there any other way? If we need to donate blood again, maybe we'll die first before catching the "guest." Actually there is another way. It's not so popular. You have to believe in it. -What's that? -Tell us! It's very special and requires you to be extremely brave. Really? If this "red underwear" kite flies and hits her, she will disappear. You know what. They are afraid of dirty things. That's why I always carry it with me. Here, hold it. It's quite simple. Ouch! Why didn't you tell us first? I forgot! So careless of you! Darn, is she home? No, the sound is from upstairs! Who's up there? Another "guest", her son. Why didn't you tell me? We have the tools now. Let's go. To have you with us is so assuring. You go first with your tool. It's so dark. Slowly. Throw the kite! Again, more power this time! What's wrong? Do it again! -Don't you hide away, go ahead! -It's all your fault! -Hurry up! -Hurry! Take it easy. Gosh, it's coming! Shh! It's burning! Put out the fire! Shh! Calm down! I can't. I will put the courtesy aside. This is my most valuable item specializing in fighting evil spirits. However strong the spirits are, it can wipe them out at once. Mister, this is no time for a lecture on the history of your item. Please hurry up! Wow, immediate effect! He's gone the moment you took it out. Oh God. We're doomed. Find another way! Gosh! Mister! Open the door. We're dead. Open the door. Ghost... I beg you. Down. Gosh! "OUT OF MY HOUSE" "GET LOST!" Run... faster! Faster! Faster! He's almost here. Wait for me. Hoang! You guys run so fast! Wait for me. Hoang. You're so fast. He's caching up. Run! Why is he running after us? Hurry up! Stop! I... It's the end of the road, there is a bridge. This bridge will take us to the highway, as Vy said. Hoang! Stop! Hoang. Stop there, son! Thong! Phuong! Luckily, I didn't fall like them! Neither of them know how to swim. We have to save them! Are you crazy? That old man said if we jump in, we'll die too. Huan! Hoang, jump in to help them. -Hurry up. -No! They're the bad guys. They're trying to harm you, mom. Why do I have to save them? Hoang, listen to me. They're friends of your sister. Vy! Son, your sister can't swim very well. Act now or it will be too late. Help me, guys! I don't know how to swim. Help me! Hoang. Are you okay? Hey, you've recovered! Are you guys okay? What about... Hoang! Hoang! Son! Thank God! You have recovered? My wish came true! Mom, I am myself again. Sister! I'm sorry. You've been like this because of me. Mom! Run! The tree is falling! Run, mom! You don't remember anything after that. You don't know who you were. You're afraid of everything. They found my body a few days later. And buried me properly. However, seeing you in that state, I couldn't just vanish. Vy, I should've told you everything from the beginning. But I couldn't find the courage. I was afraid that it would take away your happiness. I don't want to lose these last moments. Turns out, I've made things more complicated. Actually, I knew everything since I got home. Of course, I could tell how different my mom was. Then I realized, I kept lying to myself. I was afraid they will find out. So I tried to make them leave. I never wanted it to be the truth. Those days with you were my happiest. Now I don't have you by my side anymore. Mom, I'm sorry. "Mom, I'm sorry." Vy, hold on tight to what you have. Let me carry you once Mom, you've been carrying me your whole life Let me carry you once Mom, you've cared a lot for me Let me sing you a song, with all your caring words Life is like a road, full of obstacles But you carried me through, without any hesitation Let me carry you, before it's too late Let me care for you, so as my kids will do the same for me Let me lift all the burden carried on your shoulders Mom is like a withered leaf, about to part from the tree How can I ever repay your kindness that's as deep as sea? One filial deed is worth more than a hundred roses in Vu-lan festival Let me care for you, so as my kids will do the same for me "Care for your loved ones before it's too late" "Thank you for watching the movie" Hoang, to be honest... you still make me shiver. It's so scary! What are you afraid of? I'm real. So, how did you do all that? It's easy. I just need some wires and a mannequin. And some pigments, which is everywhere in the house. You scared us to death. I thought there's a ghost in your house. Hey! What did you just say, buddy? The Walking "Guests".
